Module 14 - Interactive Visualizations

**BACKGROUND**

I will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

**Horizontal Bar Chart**

Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that sample individual.
  * Used sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
  * Used otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
  * Used otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.



**PART 2: Design Your Climate App**



**RESOURCES AND REFERENCES**
During the challenge, I referenced the following to aid in my understanding and completion of the assignment:

1. Reviewed and reperformed a majority of the class activities in my GitLab Working Folder.

2. Reviewed the following instructor videos from Dr. A:
   * [SQLAlchemy Unit - Day 03 - Activity #11 - Chinook Database Analysis (Demo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8C_NuCo_7o)
   * [Module 10 Challenge Walkthrough (Updated)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEj9v-zxMv0)
     - I referenced the above code in the video for performing my assignment. Specifically, I reviewed and followed along in the video to gain an understanding of its organization and use. I then took that understanding and incorporated my knowledge and practice from the class activities to write my scripts in [climate_analysis-FINAL.ipynb](https://github.com/rperez025/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/SurfsUp/climate_analysis-FINAL.ipynb) and [app.py](https://github.com/rperez025/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/SurfsUp/app.py)
